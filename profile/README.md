# Hacker Sundae

Hacker Sundae is a hacker collective of artists, developers, students, and friends. We're a community which supports each other to explore our ideas and *hack* them into existence.

We began in 2016 by hosting a weekly *Chill Hackathon*[^1] called **Hacker Sunday** where we hack on new projects and technologies in a relaxed and sustainable way.

## Hacker Sunday

There's no specific topic except you can't hack on *"work"* projects. Hacker Sunday is a place where you can explore freely with the support of your peers. We want to set aside Sundays for you to try things out and genuinely do cool shit. *Not do more work for your corporate overlords.*

[^1]: as opposed to your usual 24 hour Hackathon
